# Python web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-aws-elastic-beanstalk-web-application/

In this project, we will learn how to create your Python web application & launch it on our own server using AWS Elastic Beanstalk technology. We will be using the Flask python framework to create our web application & AWS management console to deploy the web application to the AWS servers. 

Additionally, we will learn more about reading the server logs, how to switch between different versions of the web application & also, monitoring your AWS servers using Elastic Beanstalk Management Console.

### Learning Objectives

Create a Flask(Python) web application.

Deploy Flask(Python) web application to AWS virtual servers.

Perform AWS Elastic Beanstalk actions: Server logs, App versioning, Server monitoring
