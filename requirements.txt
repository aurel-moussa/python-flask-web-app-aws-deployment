#Using AWS Beanstalk, we'll have to tell the AWS server what packages 
#need to be installed for the application to work

#In the console, use pip3 freeze > requirements.txt to look at all the stuff that
#you locally have set in terms of packages (which you have used to make the program work)
#and then save it to the requirements.txt
#That will list ALL the modules you have installed (necessary + unnecessary)

#And then it will look something like this:
defer==1.0.6
distro-info===0.18ubuntu0.18.04.1
ec2-hibinit-agent==1.0.0
Flask==2.0.3
hibagent==1.0.1
httplib2==0.9.2
hyperlink==17.3.1
idna==2.6

#Following this, you need to zip this file here with the requirements
#and the actual Python code together and upload to AWS
